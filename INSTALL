Genome-tools
Version 1.23

######################
# Basic installation #
######################

Quick quick installation instructions:

  Run the setup.pl script, usually with

    $ ./setup.pl

  Answer all the prompts, the defaults will probably work ok for you.
  Then, run the update-genome.pl script to get some genomes to work with.

    $ update-genome.pl -help

  This will give you a help screen telling you how to use update-genome.pl.
  If you're really really impatient and have a lot of disk space, you can
  have genome-tools download all the curated prokaryotic genomes from GenBank
  by using:

    $ update-genome.pl -all

  Be warned, this may take several hours or more, but you can just leave your
  machine running, it shouldn't need much attention from you at this point.
  This command also only downloads a few hundred genomes.  The rate at which
  genomes enter NCBI has been growing quite quickly and we're not going to
  keep assigning new arbitrary orgcodes to them all.  The orgcode idea is
  still useful for some of us that have been using it for a while, but we'll
  have to transition to something more maintainable as sequencing continues
  to accelerate.

  A better way would probably be to look in
    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria
  and pick out the genomes you're interested in.  You can feed these directly
  to the update-genome.pl script, such as:

    $ update-genome.pl Acaryochloris_marina_MBIC11017_uid58167

  Then it will prompt you for orgcodes and customized ORF designations, if
  you're using a few genomes regularly this will allow you to designate your
  own orgcodes that probably make more sense to you.

  Now, you're ready to use genome-tools.  Have fun.

Note that you will need to be root if you want to install this in the
standard system directories.

You can install it as a regular user, but you must have write priveleges
over the directories you specify, which probably means you will be the
only user to be able to use it.

#####################################
# Upgrading from a previous version #
#####################################

Run the upgrade-genome-tools.pl script:

  $ ./upgrade-genome-tools.pl

This will look for a genome-tools.conf file in /etc, /usr/etc, and
/usr/local/etc.  If it can't find one or doesn't find all the information
it needs in the config file, it will abort and ask you to run setup.pl so that
a valid configuration file is made.

The default is to generate a log file called upgrade.log.

Run "./upgrade-genome-tools.pl -help" to get a help message.
