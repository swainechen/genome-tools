# genome-tools
Genome-tools: a flexible package for genome sequence analysis

This project used to be hosted at Sourceforge, but has now moved here.
I'm still working out a "permanent" server for the web application, so the following link may change. Currently you can use:
* http://3.0.152.227/genome-tools/

The original publication:
* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12503321
